# WarbleSimulation

WarbleSimulation is an application that simulates 3-dimensional space with its content, including space factors, entities, for the purpose of simulating IoT interaction.

## Current Status
### Early Development
Modules are actively being defined. Visualization is just enough for development, supported by Plotly, without optimization. Input to the program is still in the form of test cases.

## Contact
Feel free to contact yosef.saputra@gmail.com for more information and questions related to this application.

## Terminology
### Space
3-dimensional space in the form of 3-dimensional array.

### Space Factor
Components in the space. They capture different aspects in a space, for example: matter type, temperature, air movement, luminosity.

### Entity
Single encapsulated body that may have its own context, preference, intent, and action. Entity includes IoT smart things and user.

### Context
_TODO define_

### Preference
_TODO define_

### Intent
_TODO define_

### Action
